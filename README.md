# greedy-gray-codes
General algorithm framework for greedily generating [gray codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code). Includes examples. Also includes handwritten python scripts.

Research in combinatorics with [Aaron Williams](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahwQy3sAAAAJ&hl=en). Goal is to greedily generate gray codes for all objects in the [Twelvefold Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelvefold_way).
